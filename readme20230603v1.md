Dear copilot tell me
how to install rust in code spaces?



Where do we find a playground for rust?

Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
home directory, located at:

  /home/codespace/.rustup

This can be modified with the RUSTUP_HOME environment variable.

The Cargo home directory is located at:

  /home/codespace/.cargo

This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.

The cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands will be added to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:

  /home/codespace/.cargo/bin

This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:

  /home/codespace/.profile
  /home/codespace/.bashrc
  /home/codespace/.zshenv

You can uninstall at any time with rustup self uninstall and
these changes will be reverted.

Current installation options:


   default host triple: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
     default toolchain: stable (default)
               profile: default
  modify PATH variable: yes

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation

info: profile set to 'default'
info: default host triple is x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
warning: Updating existing toolchain, profile choice will be ignored
info: syncing channel updates for 'stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'
info: default toolchain set to 'stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'

  stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu unchanged - rustc 1.70.0 (90c541806 2023-05-31)


Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, run:
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

```
